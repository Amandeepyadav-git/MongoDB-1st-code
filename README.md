🗃️ MongoDB CRUD Practice

This project marks my first step into working with MongoDB — a powerful NoSQL database for modern web applications.
Here, I explored and practiced the core CRUD operations that form the foundation of every database system:

C – Create new documents

R – Read and display stored data

U – Update existing records

D – Delete unwanted entries

The goal of this mini-project was to understand how MongoDB works behind the scenes, how collections and documents are structured, and how to perform database operations using Node.js and Mongoose.
